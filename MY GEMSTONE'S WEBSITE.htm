    <b>Gemstones have attracted humankind since ancient times, and have 
long been used for jewelry. The prime requisite for a gem is that it 
must be beautiful. The beauty may lie in colour or lack of colour; in 
the latter case, extreme limpidity and “fire” may provide the 
attraction.</b>

<h>FACTS ABOUT GEMSTONES:</h>
<p>
   <b>Gemstones are graded for their hardness on what is known as “Mohs'
 Scale”. Amber is the softest gemstone, diamond is the hardest. It takes
 anywhere from one to three years to grow a cultured pearl. True pearls 
are the only jewel created by a living animal.</b>
